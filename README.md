# A brief introduction to equality in .NET with C#

> I created this in the context of the *Quick Code Wednesday* (QCW) series at Cognizant Softvision.

Equality is complex. Things that you may expect to be equal often are not. Not implementing equality explicitly can result in code that doesn't perform well.

In this repository you can find supplementary material to the video I produced (kindly edited by the Media Communications team at Cognizant Softvision).

## .NET Interactive Notebook

You can review the topics and interact with the code in the video with this .NET Interactive Notebook:

- [equality.dib](https://github.com/ignacioerrico/softvision-qcw-equality-in-dotnet/blob/main/equality.dib)

You can open the notebook with [different tools](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive). .NET developers will probably want to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Make sure you have the official [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension installed.

Got questions? [Create an issue](https://github.com/ignacioerrico/softvision-qcw-equality-in-dotnet/issues). I'd be happy to discuss it!
